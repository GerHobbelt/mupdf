API
===============================


This is the :title:`MuPDF` C API guide for developers. In this document we will guide you through the public and stable bits of the :title:`MuPDF` library. This is intended to both provide an introduction to new developers wanting to use low level features of :title:`MuPDF`, and as a reference guide to the public interface.

We will be explaining the basics, enough to get you started on a single threaded application. There are more functions and data structures used internally, and there are also ways to use :title:`MuPDF` from multiple threads, but those are beyond the scope of this document.

The functions and structures documented in this document are what we consider stable APIs. They will rarely change, and if they do, any such changes will be noted in the "api-changes" document along with instructions for how to update your code.
