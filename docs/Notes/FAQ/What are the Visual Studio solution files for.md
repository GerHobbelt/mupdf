# What are the Visual Studio `.sln` solution files used for?

* `mupdf` = production work
* `mupdf-dev` = bleeding edge & experimental work, that's being integrated into the toolset
* `m-dev-list` = the total list of projects, merely here to ensure we have easy access to all projects, even the VERY experimental ones
* `m-single` = the solution where you start your experimental work, porting & testing, before a project is ready to be integrated (into mupdf-dev solution)
